    <h1>Nathaniel Ferguson - Associate Gameplay Engineer</h1>
    <p>I'm a gameplay programmer with degrees in both computer science and game design.
    <br>I'm able to use this experience to work with designers very effectively. 
    <br>I can maximize iteration efficiency, and ensure that designers don't have to struggle to work with difficult programming. 
    <br>Currently working at Artcraft Entertainment on Crowfall.</p>

                    Crowfall is the current project I am on, of which I own a few systems on.
                    <br />Primarily, I own the flytext system, and work closely with designers and our UI team.
                    <br />I also own our metrics system, as well as our player survey system.

                    Anuhea is a Google Stadia R&D / game development project.
                    <br>I served as an intern for two months on the Anuhea project, primarily using Python and C++.
                    <br><br>I was able to get up to speed with the development pipeline 2-3 weeks faster than the lead programmer had expected, and was able to translate a unwieldy, core part of the game into a well documented, defensively programmed, and testable system.
